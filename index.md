I am a four time Founder. I created 3 SaaS companies: Dealer Ignition, Sales Ignition(https://salesignition.io/){:target="_blank"} and CRM Refresh (https://www.crmrefresh.com/){:target="_blank"}. I also founded a #1 Amazon Brand: Lux Skin Oils with my children to help teach them about startups. I bought Next Email Signatures(https://nextemailsignature.com/){:target="_blank"} and I am currently looking for more companies to purchase through Tenacious Capital(https://tenaciouscap.com/){:target="_blank"}.

On this site I write some times about ideas, observations and thoughts. Sign up to get my infrequent posts via email.
