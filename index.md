I am a four time Founder. I created 3 SaaS companies: Dealer Ignition, Sales Ignition and CRM Refresh. I also founded a #1 Amazon Brand: Lux Skin Oils with my children to help teach them about startups. I bought Next Email Signatures and I am currently looking for more companies to purchase through Tenacious Capital. 

On this site I write some times about ideas, observations and thoughts. Sign up to get my infrequent posts via email.
